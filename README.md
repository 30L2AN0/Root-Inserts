# Root-Inserts

Stl files of individual custom-made inserts and containers for the base and expansions factions of the board game Root:
- Marquise de Cat
- Eyrie Dynasties
- Woodland Alliance
- Vagabond
- Second Vagabond
- Lizard Cult
- Riverfolk Company
- Underground Duchy
- Corvid Conspiracy
- Lord of the Hundreds
- Keepers in Iron

The inserts are drawers which slide in the containers. All faction pieces, including cards, fit in their respective containers.

## Disclaimer

Only compatible with the OFFICIAL FRENCH BASE BOX of the game or CUSTOM-MADE BOXES. The containers - in the imagined configuration - are slightly too large to fit the more common box formats such as the English one.

The faction names, on the sides of the containers, are WRITTEN IN FRENCH.

Not the most compact storage, but I like the way it presents. Space lost to put pieces in a pleasant configuration. Narrowest containers (Alliance and 2nd Vagabond) are a third of the largest ones. Medium-sized containers are two thirds of the largest ones. This design makes containers' positions interchangeable.

The containers files may be a little broken (the Vagabond one especially), but all should print correctly.
The drawers files all went through a mesh repair step and look clean except for the Keepers in Iron one which is a little weird around the ears. All were printed without issues.

## Process

Made using Inscape, GIMP, Blender, and the "Model Repair" tool form Creality Print.

## Future Improvements

English box compatibility.. maybe.. if I get motivated..
