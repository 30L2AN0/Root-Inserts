# Root-Inserts

Stl files of individual custom-made inserts and containers for the base and expansions factions of Root, the board game:
- Marquise de Cat
- Eyrie Dynasties
- Woodland Alliance
- Vagabond
- Second Vagabond
- Lizard Cult
- Riverfolk Company
- Underground Duchy
- Corvid Conspiracy
- Lord of the Hundreds
- Keepers in Iron

## Disclaimer

Only compatible with the OFFICIAL FRENCH BASE BOX of the game or CUSTOM-MADE BOXES. The containers - in the imagined configuration - are slightly too large to fit the more common box formats like the English one.

The faction names, on the sides of the containers, are WRITTEN IN FRENCH.

Not the most compact storage, but I like the way it presents. Space lost to put pieces in a pleasant configuration.

The containers files all a little broken (the Vagabond one especially), but all should print correctly.
The drawers files are ...

## Process

Made using Inscape, GIMP, Blender, and the fix model tool form Creality Print.

## Future Improvements

English box compatibility.. maybe.. if I get motivated..
